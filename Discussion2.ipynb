        "One thing that was really facinating was seeing how different music recommender systems worked. The use of echonest, which uses audio context and metadata was interesting, and that platforms such as Sonza and Pandora would spend so much time manually tagging songs sounded very time intensive. \n",

In addition, they were able to filter data so that each user only needs the data that is relevant to it's recommendation system. It was really interesting to see how to optimize a recommendation system while eloquently speaking about the math behind it. "
